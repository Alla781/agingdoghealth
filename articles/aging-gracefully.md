Dogs age differently depending on breed, size, and lifestyle.  
Recognising early signs helps you give them the best care possible.

•⁠  ⁠*Mobility changes:* Watch for stiffness after rest.  
•⁠  ⁠*Greying muzzle:* Often the first visible sign.  
•⁠  ⁠*Energy levels:* Seniors need shorter, more frequent walks.  
•⁠  ⁠*Diet tweaks:* Senior formulas support joints and digestion.  

Remember: small daily habits make a big difference for an aging friend.
